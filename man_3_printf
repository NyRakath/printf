.SH NAME
.B _printf
- Formatted output conversion

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B #include "main.h"

.B int _printf(const char *
.I format
.B , ... )

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
Produces output under the control of a 
.I format
string that specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for output.

.SH Format of the format string
The format string is a character string composed of zero o more directives: ordinary characters that are not %, which are copied unchanged to the output stream. The format is composed of conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments. Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier.
.PP
The arguments must correspond properly with the conversion specifier. By default, the arguments are used in the order given.

.SH Conversion specifiers
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:
.TP
.B c
The int argument is converted to an unsigned char, and the resulting character is written.
.TP
.B s
the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type (pointer to a string). Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte ('\0').
.TP
.B d, i
The int argument is converted to signed decimal notation.
.TP
.B %
A '%' is written but no argument is converted. The complete version specification is '%%'.

.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful return, all functions return the number of characters printed, excluding the null byte to end output to strings. If an output error is encountered, a negative value is returned.

.SH EXAMPLE
To print a date and time under the form of "Tuesday, November 9, 7:22", where day (name) and month are pointers to strings, and day (number) and hours are integers:
.PP
#include "main.h"

_printf("%s, %s %d, %d\\n", "Tuesday", "November", 9, 7, 22);

.SH BUGS
No knows bugs.
